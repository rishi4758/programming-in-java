/*Nested classes means class within another class.It is of two types
(1)Static Nested class (2) Inner Class(Non-Static nested class).
 This program implememts concept of Static Nested class.Inside nested
 class all the static data members of enclosing class can be modified
 and accessed directly. All the non static data members can be 
modified or accessed by making the object of enclosing class. all the
 data members of static nested class can have any access modifier.
main method can be defined inside static nested class, but then at run 
time we will write java outerclassname$staticnestedclassname .*/
