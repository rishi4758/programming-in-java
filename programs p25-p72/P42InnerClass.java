/*To implement non static nested class, (Inner class).Inside inner
 class all the static and non static data members of enclosing class 
can be modified and accessed. all the data members of non static 
nested class can have any access modifier except "static". Static is 
only allowed when data member is of type final.main method can not be
 defined inside non static nested class, as nonstatic class can not 
have static data members and member methods and main is static in java.*/
