/*this program performs basic inheritence when sub class, instead of 
as it is inheriting the common properties(DM) and behaviour (MM)of 
super class,the subclass is having priviledge to provide a new 
defination to the inherited feature (Concept called Overriding).
But now with the object of sub class i want to call the method of 
super class using "super" keyword over Data members,member methods 
and constructor. Super is by default non static*/
