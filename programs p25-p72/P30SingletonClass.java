/* Java program implementing Singleton class (class for which only 
one object can be created): to make any class singleton there are 
two conditions: 
(1) Its constructor should be made private: so that no new object can
 be created from outside the class.
(2) It should have one public(accessible everywhere) static
 (without making object can be called) method with return type, with 
which outside world interact with singleton class. As it is the member
 of the class ,it can even access the private constructor of the class*/
