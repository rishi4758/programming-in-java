/*this program implements the concept of Interface.An interface is 
advancement in abstract class.It can only have abstract(have to be 
overridden),default and static methods.Object of interface cant be 
created.It does not have constructor.All the abstract methods of 
interface have to be overridden by the class which implements the 
interface. The class implements interface can override default methods
. One CTE of weaker access will come: Because it says if super class 
or interface have an access specifier with its method then the 
subclass extends or implements the super class or interface have to 
provide a strong access specifier.order of access specifier is 
(private<default<protected<public).*/
