/*this program implements Abstract class.if any class has one method 
as abstract (method with anstract keyword),it should be declared 
abstract class (abstract keyword in front of class).abstract method
is something whose defination cant be given, just declaration is given
in the parent class.Now the subclass either have to override the 
abstract method or it should declate itself as an abstract class.
An abstract class can have abstract(have to be overridden) and non 
abstract methods.Object of abstract class cant be created because its 
constructor is protected so it can be accessed by subclasses only.
1) It is possible to declare a class as an abstract class without 
having any abstract method.
2) When subclass is also declared as abstract class.it is not 
compulsory for it to define all the abstract methods of its super
 class.It may or may not define it.*/
